                <p>Hello,</p>
                <p>My name is Christopher Chew and I was born and raised in San Francisco, CA. I am an aspiring Software Engineer, graduated from University of California, Merced with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My goal is to improve my technical skills and to learn about the innovative technologies the world has to offer. </p>
                <p>For my senior project in school, my team and I participated in our annual Mobile App Challenge. We created a android application called <b>Music Notes.</b> This application allows people to compose music by dragging notes onto the screen and playing it back as if it would be on the piano. Our idea awarded us 1st place in the competition against 10 different teams.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 2014, I interned at Irvine Sensors in Costa Mesa, CA as a Engineering Intern, Cognitive Systems. My task/project required me to create a Object data structure that stores meta data from the video feed and implement it along with the rest of the code.  </p>
