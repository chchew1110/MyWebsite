        <p>As one of my self-driven projects, I created an Android application to help calculate an annual competition we had for our fraternity called the Best Line Award. </p>

            <div class="right-picture"><img src="BestLineAward/mainmenu.png"></div>
        </div>
        <p>The left picture is shown when the application is first launched. This is the main menu where the user can choose which line they would like to calculate the scores. Once you click on a line, the application's Intent switches over to the respective layout. </p>
        <h1>How score is calculated</h1>
        <p>In our fraternity, every member needs to complete a certain number of Leadership, Fellowship, and Service hours depending on their membership status (Active, Associate, or Pledge). Each member in the line will need to complete the minimum amount before their hours contribute to the award. If one member does not complete their minimum, their points contribute negatively to the award.</p>
        <h1>Program logistics</h1>

        </div>
        <p>Everytime the user press the Add Members button on the top, a new row will be created where the user can input a Name, choose membership status, and enter the number of leadership, fellowship, and service hours the member did. When a new row is added, The Total (located on the bottom left hand corner) automatically subtracts 38 (Active) or 27 (Associate or Pledge). When adding hours to each category hours, the Total automatically gets calculated. </p>
